# Some Explanations

The way to make the Bookdown generated TeX files works of the elegantbook class is to use `bookdown.post.latex` option to modify the generated tex file. Due the natural of the fancy definition of theorem environments in elegantbook, the current hack of theorem environments is to add `{}{}` to the end to `\BeginKnitrBlock{}`. Note that the name and label options for bookdown theorem environments still cann't be handled at this moment. An alternative option is to define theorem environments using pandoc fence blocks and lua to translate them into tex environments. This is the way, how Think, Note, and Tip environments work in this demo.

**In the following Chapter, you will see a demo of how theorem environments work with elegantbook class.**  If you have any suggestions/comments, please submit them to this repo. Thank you!
