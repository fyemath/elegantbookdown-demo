## Don't Be Tricked

::: {.rmdthink}

1. A pizza shop sales 12-inches pizza and 8-inches pizza at the price \$12/each and \$6/each respectively.  With \$12, would you like to order one 12-inches and two 8-inches. Why?

2. A sheet of everyday copy paper is about 0.01 millimeter thick. Repeat folding along a different side 20 times. Now, how thick do you think the folded paper is?

## Properties of Exponents

For an integer $n$, and an expression $x$, the mathematical operation of the $n$-times repeated multiplication of $x$  is call exponentiation, written as $x^n$, that is,
$$
x^n=\underbrace{x\cdot x \cdots x}_{n~\text{factors of}~x}.
$$

In the notation $x^n$, $n$ is called ***the exponent***, $x$ is called ***the base***, and $x^n$ is called ***the power***, read as "$x$ raised to the $n$-th power",  "$x$ to the $n$-th power", "$x$ to the $n$-th", "$x$ to the power of $n$" or "$x$ to the $n$".

**Order of Basic Mathematical Operations**  

In mathematics, the order of operations reflects conventions about which procedure should be performed first. There are four levels (from the highest to the lowest):

**Parenthesis**; **Exponentiation**; **Multiplication and Division**; **Addition and Subtraction**.  

Within the same level, the convention is to perform from the left to the right.

Simplify. **Write with positive exponents.**
$$
\left(\dfrac{2y^{-2}z^{-5}}{4x^{-3}y^6}\right)^{-4}.
$$

:::{.sol}

The idea is to simplify the base first and rewrite using positive exponents only.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \left(\dfrac{2y^{-2}z^{-5}}{4x^{-3}y^6}\right)^{-4}
=&\left(\dfrac{x^3}{2z^{5}y^8}\right)^{-4}\\
=&\left(\dfrac{2z^{5}y^8}{x^3}\right)^4\\
=&\dfrac{2^4(z^{5})^4(y^8)^4}{(x^3)^4}\\
=&\dfrac{16y^{32}z^{20}}{x^{12}}.\\
\end{aligned}
$$

**Simplify (at least partially) the problem first**  
To avoid mistakes when working with negative exponents, it's better to apply the negative exponent rule to change negative exponents to positive exponents and simplify the base first.

## Generating Theorem Environments Using R Bookdown Code Chunks

Bookdown theorem environments work great. It will be awesome if it can handle r code chunks within a theorem block.

```{theorem, name="Pythagorean Theorem", label="ggThm"}

If $c$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides, the Pythagorean theorem can be expressed as the Pythagorean equation:
$$a^2+b^2=c^2.$$

```

````{corollary}

For any angle $\theta$, we have
$$
\sin^2\theta+\cos^2\theta=1
$$

```

## Generating Theorem Environments Using Pandoc Fence Code Blocks

Bookdown has a lua filter called "latex-div.lua" which handles theorem environments for latex.

::: {.thm title="Pythagorean Theorem" label="pyThm"}

If $c$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse and $a$
 and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides,
 the Pythagorean theorem can be expressed as the Pythagorean equation:
$$a^2+b^2=c^2.$$

::: {.cor}

For any angle $\theta$, we have
$$
\sin^2\theta+\cos^2\theta=1
$$

:::

::: {.lem}

Pandoc use `::: {#Id .Div_attributes}` to start and `:::`
 to end a Div block. Such a block can be converted
  to LaTeX environment using lua.

A store has large size and small size watermelons. A large one cost \$4 and a small one \$1. Putting on the same table, a smaller watermelons has only half the height of the larger one. Given \$4, will you buy a large watermelon or 4 smaller ones? Why?
